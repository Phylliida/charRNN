# charRNN
Recurrent neural networks that are fast, easy to use, and can reproduce [The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/)

The rnn code, text parsing code, and shakespeare data is taken from [https://github.com/martin-gorner/tensorflow-rnn-shakespeare](https://github.com/martin-gorner/tensorflow-rnn-shakespeare), I just cleaned up the code to make it easier to use

The movies folder contains the dataset I got from [here](https://github.com/suriyadeepan/practical_seq2seq)

I also combined all linux source code files into a single .txt file, you can download that [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nOsvza-zcQh60FLZHsoU4qbJpbUNS1me/view?usp=sharing)
