# unreasonableRnn
Recurrent neural networks that are fast, easy to use, and can reproduce [The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/)

The rnn code and text parsing code is taken from [https://github.com/martin-gorner/tensorflow-rnn-shakespeare](https://github.com/martin-gorner/tensorflow-rnn-shakespeare), I just cleaned it up to make it easier to use
